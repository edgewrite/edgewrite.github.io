<h4>Edge Write</h4>
<p>
Edge Write is a thrilling and challenging web-based writing application designed to push the limits of your focus and creativity. Choose between two distinct modes - Hardcore and Easy - and set a custom timer to face a unique test of your writing skills.

In Hardcore mode, the app blurs your text as you type, forcing you to concentrate and write without the luxury of reviewing your work. In Easy mode, you can see your text, but the timer turns red if you stop typing for more than 1.5 seconds, warning you that your writing progress is at risk. If you remain inactive for 3 seconds, the screen turns black, and your entire text is deleted, resetting the timer.

Built to challenge your determination and boost productivity, The Most Dangerous Writing App pushes you to keep writing and maintain a steady flow of thoughts without overthinking or pausing too long. It's daring, it's intense, and it's perfect for those who seek an adventurous way to enhance their writing skills and explore new creative horizons.
